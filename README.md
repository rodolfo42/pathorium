# Pathorium

## Get a hold of your path entries once and for all

Pathorium is a small web-based app to manage and visualize your PATH entries one by one.

Useful for people like me who keeps trying out new stuff like languages, frameworks, libraries, command-line programs, but also likes to keep things tidy in their system.

This is manly a spike for [Dart](http://www.dartlang.org/), a new language to "replace" javascript in the future.
